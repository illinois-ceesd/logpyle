Welcome to logpyle's documentation!
===================================

:mod:`logpyle` is a Python package for time series logging (formerly part of
the ``pytools.log`` and ``datapyle`` packages) that uses :mod:`sqlite3` under
the hood and makes it easy to compare multiple runs.

Here's an example use of the interface in context. See the :ref:`tutorial`
for a more complete introduction.
